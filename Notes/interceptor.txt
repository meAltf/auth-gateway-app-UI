With an Interceptor:
    Attach credentials (cookies / headers)
    Every HTTP request passes through one place
    We catch 401 / 403 globally
    Auto-logout + redirect to /login
    Cleaner components (less code)


| Layer       | Responsibility     |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Guard       | Validate session   |
| Interceptor | Handle HTTP errors |
| Component   | Display data only  |
| Service     | Business logic     |


Session expired
→ API → 401
→ interceptor catches
→ toast shown
→ redirect to /session-expired
→ guard blocks further access
