1. What is an Observable?
    An Observable is something that gives data over time.
    Not just once — it can give multiple values.
    Angular uses Observables a lot for API calls, events, async data.
    Very powerful with operators like map, filter, catchError.

2. subscribe() means :
    “Hey Observable, start sending me data”.

3. Key points to remember:
    Observable does nothing until you subscribe
    It can emit: data, error, complete signal
    You should unsubscribe to avoid memory leaks

4. pipe() like a processing pipeline:
    API response → process → decide → output

5. of(false) means:
    “Return an Observable that emits false.” | Observable<true | false>

6. Simple analogy:

    Promise → “I’ll give you data once”. | It's auto executes, Cannot cancel, one value
    Observable → “I’ll keep giving you data whenever it changes”. | It's Executes on subscribe, can cancel, multiple value

Important:
    HTTP is async because the browser sends the request, continues execution, 
    and notifies Angular later when the response arrives.
